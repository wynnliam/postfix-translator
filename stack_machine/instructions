Arithmetic:
+
-
/
*

Stack Manipulation:
push v -- Pushes v onto stack
rvalue l -- pushes contents of l onto stack
lvalue l -- pushes address of l onto stack
pop -- throw away top value onto the stack
:= -- r value on top placed in l value below it and both are popped
copy -- pushes a copy of top value onto stack.

Control Flow:
label l -- target of jumps to l; has no other effect.
goto l -- next instruction is taken from statement with label l
gofalse l -- pop top value; jump if it is zero
gotrue l -- pop top value; jump if not zero.
halt -- stop all execution
